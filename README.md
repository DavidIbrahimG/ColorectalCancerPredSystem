# Colorectal Cancer Prediction Pipeline

## üìå Project Overview
This project focuses on building an **end-to-end machine learning pipeline** for predicting **5-year survival outcomes** in colorectal cancer patients.  
The pipeline covers **data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, deployment via Flask, containerization with Docker, and orchestration using Kubeflow Pipelines**.

Colorectal cancer remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Early detection and risk assessment can significantly improve patient survival rates and treatment outcomes.  
This project leverages real-world patient data to develop a predictive model that can assist healthcare professionals in making informed decisions.

## üß™ Workflow

### 1. **Data Preprocessing**
- Cleaned and handled missing values.
- Encoded categorical features.
- Scaled numerical features for model consistency.

### 2. **Feature Selection**
- Applied **Chi-Square test** to select the **top 5 most influential features** impacting survival outcomes.

### 3. **Model Training**
- Used supervised learning models to predict **5-year survival**.
- Evaluated performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### 4. **Flask Web UI**
- Built an interactive web application for predictions.
- Users can input patient details and receive survival probability.

### 5. **Containerization with Docker**
- Packaged the Flask application into a **Docker image** for easy deployment.

### 6. **Pipeline Orchestration with Kubeflow**
- Created a **Kubeflow pipeline** to automate:
  - Data preprocessing
  - Model training
  - Model deployment
- Ensured reproducibility and scalability.
